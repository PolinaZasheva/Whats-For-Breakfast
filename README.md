Multiclass Classification using Keras and TensorFlow on Food-101 Dataset

Overview:
---
  * Download and extract Food 101 dataset
  * Understand dataset structure and files
  * Select three classes to train model on: omlet, french toast, waffles
  * Split the image data into train and test using train.txt and test.txt
  * Create a subset of data with few classes(3)
  * Train the model locally and load results to colab notebook
  * Host model in Github
  * Host applicaiton and front end interface on Heroku
  
 Findings: 
 ---
   * Challenge 1: The data files and model code was too large to host on the standard GitHub Repository. 
      *Soulution 1: We used GitHub LFS to load the large file into our GitHub Repository
